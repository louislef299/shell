# Personal Shell

This is a custom shell written in C that I intend to build on. Big shout-out to
[Stephen Brennan][] for his help getting this project kick-started and getting
me back into the groove of OS-level programming.

## Running the Shell

The shell runs in an emulated mode where memory is accessed through a file. If
the emulation mode still makes you nervous, you can run the program from a
container.
